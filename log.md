# 100 Days Of Code - Leif Latiff - Log
My name is Leif. I'm a Javascript enthusiast. Know me better at fishingelephants[dot]com.

I've taken the 100 Days of Code challenge on January 1st, 2018 and this is where I publish my daily progress.

### Day 14: January 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Advanced #Javascript - Build fun quiz game in the console 
- To display the next random question after the results, so that the game never ends
- User are able to end the game by typing 'exit'
- Add 1 point to user's score
- Display the score in the console

**Thoughts:** 
- Covered everything from the last lectures.
- Good practice and I was able to figure out some functions.
- Still a long way to go to code on my own.

### Day 13: January 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Advanced #Javascript - Build fun quiz game in the console 
- Question prompt and ask for correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer
- To check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not
- To make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with the other programmers code as if this is a plugin

**Thoughts:** 
- Pretty much practising what I have learned in previous lectures. 
- Banging my head back and forth for the notes.
